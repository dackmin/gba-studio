## You want to contribute some code?

I'm always looking for quality contributions and will be happy to accept your Pull Requests as long as they adhere to some basic rules:

* Please make sure that your contribution fits well in the project's context:
  * I'm trying to keep the core of GBA Studio as small and light as possible, with the least amount of dependencies possible
  * If you need an external dependency, please make sure that it is well maintained, has a permissive license and is really necessary
* Please ensure that you are submitting quality code, specifically make sure that:
  * your code conforms to the current set of eslint/ts rules
  * your commits conform to the conventions established [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QrDFcIiPjSLDn3EL15IJygNPiHORgU1_OOAqWjiDU5Y/edit#)
